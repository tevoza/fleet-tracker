\section{Evaluation}
Evaluation of the system is performed by testing the deployed \ac{io} server and web application with several Android devices which are available.

\subsection{Android application}
Four Android devices were readily available for testing purposes, which are highlighted in table \ref{tab:android_devices_tested}.
