\begin{abstract}
\noindent Trucking companies require a means to track their employees, ensuring they perform their work as expected, and do so in a safe, legal manner.
Acceleration, altitude, location and speed are identified variables of interest to adequately determine trucking behavior.
This brings about the need for a real-time tracking system, logging these variables for each trucker in a fleet.\\

\noindent Dedicated, single-purpose boards with GPS and sensor capability offer a common solution.
Another solution is offered by making use of smartphones, for their multipurpose capabilities.
Managers may require their truckers to make use of other smartphone applications, potentially including stock-tracking and communication systems.
One smartphone could perform all of these activities if tracking was also handled by the device.
To this end, a software tracking solution is proposed making use of smartphone devices with built-in GPS and sensor capability.
The proposal entails the development of a smartphone application for continuous data logging, an input/output server for relaying data from the smartphones to a central data store, and a web application allowing managers to manage and view data from their truckers.
The main identified objective is to provide managers an interface to monitor the movement of their truckers.\\

\noindent Software design principles are utilized in the design and implementation of an Android application, asynchronous input/output server in C++ and a web application in C\# using the ASP.NET web framework.
Common design paradigms which aim to improve the modularity and scalability of software are implemented in the solution.
A simple algorithm is implemented for processing raw GPS data, determining the truckers activities which includes start/stop times and average acceleration, altitude, location and speed during trips.\\

\noindent The resulting implemented solution allows Android users to operate the application in the background while doing other tasks.
Managers using the web application are presented with a map interface highlighting trip paths, stopping points and times, and graphs showcasing percentile distributions of the logged variables.
The solution is tested on several Android devices, with reports accessed for correctness.
\\

\noindent Reliability concerns are noted, with the Android application dependent on the user making proper use of it.
Further software improvements are identified for improving the robustness of the solution up-time.
The proposed solution presents an interesting alternative for budget conscious managers, who require extra functionality in addition to just tracking.
